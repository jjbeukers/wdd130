            <h2>How to Properly Prepare and Store Fruit</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing to consider when preparing your fruit for the week is which fruit should be eaten first.
                Some fruit is more delicate and should be consumed before the other hardier fruits. Storage is also 
                important. Delicate fruit can be preserved longer if it is treated properly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the following fruit lineup for the week:
            </p>
            <p>
                Apples
            </p>
            <p>
                Kiwi
            </p>
            <p>
                Strawberries
            </p>
            <p>
                Cuties
            </p> 
            <p>
                I like to make time in my week for two separate food prep sessions. I usually need about an hour on 
                Monday and another hour on Thursday. Monday is when I prepare the fruit that should be eaten first. 
                From the list above, the more delicate fruit would be the kiwis and strawberries. To make those as 
                easy to eat as possible, I wash them and prepare them for immediate consumption. Kiwis are peeled and 
                cut in slices, and for the strawberries I remove the leaves on the top and quarter them. For storage, 
                I place them in a tupperware container with a paper towel in the bottom. The paper towel helps the more 
                delicate produce items last longer in the fridge. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point you may be asking yourself, "How difficult is it to cut a few strawberries right before 
                lunch?" And I will respond by saying, it's not too hard at all. However, I have 5 small children, and 
                lunchtime can be hectic. If I want my kids to eat healthy food it needs to be the most convenient option. 
                In a perfect world I would have 15 uninterrupted minutes to prepare a healthy lunch for my kids, but 
                that rarely happens. When kids get hungry and chaos ensues, I am always happy I am prepared!
