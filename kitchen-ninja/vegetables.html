            <h2>How to Properly Prepare and Store Vegetables</h2>
            <p>
                Vegetable prep is extremely important when it comes to healthy eating. I rarely have to get after my 
                kids to eat their fruit, but I do have to give them a lot of encouragement to eat their vegetables. 
                Something I have learned is that a hungry kid is more likely to eat vegetables if it's their only 
                option. I keep a vegetable tray in my fridge and load it up with snacking veggies when I do my food prep. 
                When my kids start begging for food half an hour before mealtimes I simply pull out the veggie tray and 
                set it on the counter. It is quick and easy, and I'm never bothered if my kids fill their bellies with 
                vegetables before dinner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When filling a veggie tray, there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, most vegetables fare 
                better when set on a paper towel. Cucumbers will quickly go bad if you just throw them in a veggie tray. 
                But if you slice them and place a paper towel under them it will surprise you how long they will keep. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Another advantage to a vegetable tray is it makes a quick and easy on the go lunch side. Every so often 
                we get invitations from friends to do playdates at the park. It is so fast to just grab a loaf of bread, 
                peanut butter,jelly, a tupperware of fruit, and grab an assortment of vegetables from the tray.
