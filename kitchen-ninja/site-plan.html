        If you are like me, getting the members of your household to eat healthily can be quite a challenge. You start
        off your week with the best of intentions, but by the end of the week the cucumbers you bought are still sitting 
        in the drawer of your fridge getting moldy. Maybe you just need more motivation to get through all of that produce?
        No, motivation is not the answer, but preparation is. By spending just two hours a week properly preparing the
        fruit and vegetables in your fridge, you can not only making healthy eating faster, but more convenient as well.

      </ul>
      <h3>Fruit Prep</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing to consider when preparing your fruit for the week is which fruit should be eaten first. Some 
        fruit is more delicate and should be consumed before the other hardier fruits. Storage is also important. Delicate 
        fruit can be preserved longer if it is treated properly. 

        Consider the following fruit lineup for the week:

        Apples
        Kiwi 
        Strawberries 
        Cuties

        I like to make time in my week for two separate food prep sessions. I usually need about an hour on Monday and 
        another hour on Thursday. Monday is when I prepare the fruit that should be eaten first. From the list above, the 
        more delicate fruit would be the kiwis and strawberries. To make those as easy to eat as possible, I wash them and
        prepare them for immediate consumption. Kiwis are peeled and cut in slices, and for the strawberries I remove the 
        leaves on the top and quarter them. For storage, I place them in a tupperware container with a paper towel in the 
        bottom. The paper towel helps the more delicate produce items last longer in the fridge. 

        At this point you may be asking yourself, "How difficult is it to cut a few strawberries right before lunch?" And 
        I will respond by saying, it's not too hard at all. However, I have 5 small children, and lunchtime can be hectic. 
        If I want my kids to eat healthy food it needs to be the most convenient option. In a perfect world I would have 15 
        uninterrupted minutes to prepare a healthy lunch for my kids, but that rarely happens. When kids get hungry and 
        chaos ensues, I am always happy I am prepared!

      <h3>Vegetable Prep</h3>
      <p>
        Vegetable prep is extremely important when it comes to healthy eating. I rarely have to get after my kids to eat
        their fruit, but I do have to give them a lot of encouragement to eat their vegetables. Something I have learned 
        is that a hungry kid is more likely to eat vegetables if it's their only option. I keep a vegetable tray in my 
        fridge and load it up with snacking veggies when I do my food prep. When my kids start begging for food half an 
        hour before mealtimes I simply pull out the veggie tray and set it on the counter. It is quick and easy, and I'm 
        never bothered if my kids fill their bellies with vegetables before dinner. 

        When filling a veggie tray, there's a few things to keep in mind. First of all, most vegetables fare better when 
        set on a paper towel. Cucumbers will quickly go bad if you just throw them in a veggie tray. But if you slice them 
        and place a paper towel under them it will surprise you how long they will keep. 
        
        Another advantage to a vegetable tray is it makes a quick and easy on the go lunch side. Every so often we get 
        invitations from friends to do playdates at the park. It is so fast to just grab a loaf of bread, peanut butter,
        jelly, a tupperware of fruit, and grab an assortment of vegetables from the tray.
