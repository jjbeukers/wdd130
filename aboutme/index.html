    Hello, everyone, my name is Jen. I graduated from Utah State University
    in 2014 with a degree in statistics. Now I am returning to get a degree in
    applied technology. I would like to work as a Biostatistician someday when 
    my kids are grown. My husband and I have been married for nearly 10 years. 
    We have 4 young children and one more expected any time. Together my family
    and I enjoy hiking, camping, and gardening. 
    <p>
    I started attending BYU-I last winter, and I have really been enjoying the
    flexibility of the program. I am a stay at home mom and keep quite busy with 
    the kids, but it has been nice to start school again. Technology changes so 
    fast, so I thought it would be a good idea to take a few courses a semester 
    until I'm ready to start a job in order to stay relevant. 
    <p>
    I'm excited to start this semester and learn more about web design with each 
    of you. It's something I've never done before, but I look forward to the 
    challenge!
